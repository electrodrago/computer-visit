# CVL: Computer Vision Self-Learning Project

CVL is a small multi-project that has been done by two members.
Our goal is to experience various small projects with public datasets to learn computer vision.

Our present research-pipeline is: image classifier simple - advanced image classifier - data augmentation - transfer learning - image detection - semantic segmentation.

Almost all of the projects are run on Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
